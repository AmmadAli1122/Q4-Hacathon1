# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI documentation. This collection of modules will guide you through the essential concepts of bridging artificial intelligence with physical robotics systems.

## Modules


- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**  
  Introduces ROS 2 as the communication backbone of robotics systems, explaining how nodes, topics, and services enable coordination between software agents and physical robot components.

- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Simulation & Perception)**  
  Covers physics-based simulation and environment modeling, showing how digital twins and virtual sensors allow robots to perceive gravity, collisions, and sensory data in controlled virtual worlds.

- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (Humanoid Autonomy)**  
  Focuses on perception, mapping, and navigation, explaining how AI systems enable humanoid robots to understand their surroundings and move intelligently within complex environments.

- **Module 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)**  
  Explores how language models, perception, and control systems combine to translate human commands into autonomous robotic actions, culminating in a fully integrated humanoid system.
