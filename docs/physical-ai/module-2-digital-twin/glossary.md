# Glossary: Simulation Terminology

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications, including simulation environments.

## B

**BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)**: A function that describes how light is reflected at an opaque surface, used for realistic material simulation.

## C

**Collision Detection**: The computational problem of detecting when two or more objects come into contact with each other in a simulation.

**Cross-Reality Transfer**: The process of transferring knowledge, behaviors, or trained models from virtual simulation to real-world robotic systems.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual replica of a physical robot that exists in a simulated environment, complete with accurate physics, sensor models, and environmental conditions.

**Domain Randomization**: A technique for training AI models with varied simulation parameters to make them robust to real-world variations.

**Dynamic Environment**: A simulation environment where elements change over time, including moving obstacles, changing lighting, or evolving scenarios.

## E

**Environment Modeling**: The process of creating virtual representations of physical spaces, including terrain, obstacles, and other environmental features.

## G

**Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation environment that provides accurate physics simulation, environment modeling, and sensor simulation capabilities.

**Ground Truth**: The accurate and complete information about the state of a simulated environment, used for validating sensor data and perception algorithms.

## H

**Hardware Abstraction**: The process of hiding the details of physical hardware from software, allowing the same software to work with different hardware implementations.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances.

**LOD (Level of Detail)**: A technique for adjusting the complexity of 3D models based on their distance from the viewer or importance in the scene.

## P

**Perception System**: The component of a robot that processes sensor data to understand its environment and internal state.

**Photorealistic Rendering**: The process of creating computer-generated images that are indistinguishable from real photographs.

**Physics Engine**: Software that simulates physical interactions, including gravity, collisions, and forces.

**Plugin System**: A framework that allows additional functionality to be added to a simulation environment without modifying the core code.

## R

**Real-time Simulation**: A simulation that runs at the same rate as actual time, allowing for interactive control and monitoring.

**Reproducibility**: The ability to recreate identical simulation conditions and results across multiple runs.

**ROS# (ROS Sharp)**: A Unity package that enables communication between Unity and ROS 2.

**ROS 2**: The Robot Operating System version 2, a flexible framework for writing robot software.

## S

**Sensor Simulation**: The process of creating virtual sensor data that mimics the behavior of real-world sensors.

**Sim2Real (Simulation-to-Reality)**: The approach of transferring knowledge, behaviors, or trained models from simulation to real-world robotic systems.

**Simulation**: The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.

**Subsurface Scattering**: A phenomenon where light penetrates the surface of translucent materials and scatters before exiting.

## T

**Time Determinism**: The property of a simulation where the same initial conditions and inputs always produce the same results, regardless of when or where the simulation is run.

**Twinning**: The process of creating and maintaining a digital twin that accurately reflects a physical system.

## U

**Unity**: A real-time 3D development platform used for creating photorealistic simulations and sensor data.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing a robot model, including kinematic and dynamic properties.

## V

**Virtual Sensor**: A simulated sensor that produces data mimicking real-world sensor behavior within a simulation environment.

## W

**WebSockets**: A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, used for real-time data transfer between simulation and control systems.

## Z

**Zero Gravity Simulation**: A simulation environment where gravitational forces are set to zero, used for testing space robotics applications.
