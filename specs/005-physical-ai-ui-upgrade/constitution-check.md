**Feature**: 005-physical-ai-ui-upgrade
**Date**: 2025-12-26
**Constitution Version**: 1.0.0

## Alignment Verification

This document verifies that the UI upgrade project aligns with the project constitution principles and standards.

## Core Principles Alignment

### I. Specification-First Development ✅
- [x] All UI changes originate from clear specifications (spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md)
- [x] Specifications are version-controlled and executable
- [x] Implementation follows the defined data model and requirements
- [x] All UI components have documented specifications in data-model.md

### II. Content Groundedness & Verifiability ✅
- [x] UI upgrade preserves all existing content without modification
- [x] Visual changes enhance rather than alter core content meaning
- [x] No new content is created that requires verification beyond styling
- [x] All styling decisions are based on the defined visual requirements

### III. AI-Native Authoring Discipline ✅
- [x] Claude Code used as collaborative agent for UI development
- [x] Human-readable structure maintained alongside AI-readable specs
- [x] Clear separation between content (unchanged) and presentation (enhanced)
- [x] All UI decisions documented in research.md and spec.md

### IV. Transparency & Reproducibility ✅
- [x] All UI changes are committed and documented
- [x] Configuration files updated appropriately for new styling
- [x] Build process remains reproducible with new UI elements
- [x] CSS variables and styling system is transparent and maintainable

### V. User-Centric Knowledge Access ✅
- [x] UI enhancements improve content accessibility and readability
- [x] Visual hierarchy supports better knowledge consumption
- [x] Navigation improvements aid user orientation and learning flow
- [x] Accessibility standards maintained (WCAG compliance)

### VI. Quality and Integrity Standards ✅
- [x] Typography and spacing optimize readability (Flesch-Kincaid considerations)
- [x] Visual design maintains professional standards
- [x] All UI elements are properly implemented and tested
- [x] Performance standards maintained (no significant slowdown)
