## Prompt

--title "Created Module 3 Specification NVIDIA Isaac AI" --stage spec

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the specification for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™), including all required sections: User Scenarios & Testing, Functional Requirements, Key Entities, and Success Criteria.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Physical AI Module 3 covering NVIDIA Isaac technologies, perception systems, and navigation for humanoid robots
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/003-nvidia-isaac-ai/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan, /sp.tasks to break down implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification follows the template structure and addresses all aspects of the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for robotic perception and navigation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: No automated PHR creation script available, had to create manually
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement automated PHR creation functionality
