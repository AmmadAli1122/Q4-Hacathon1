## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the implementation tasks for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™), organizing them by user story priority and including all necessary setup, foundational, and content creation tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task breakdown for Physical AI Module 3 covering NVIDIA Isaac technologies, perception systems, and navigation for humanoid robots
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/003-nvidia-isaac-ai/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of individual tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The tasks follow the user story priority structure and provide clear, actionable steps for content creation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: No automated PHR creation script available, had to create manually
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement automated PHR creation functionality
