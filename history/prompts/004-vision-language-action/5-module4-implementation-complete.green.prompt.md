## Prompt

make module 4 full working as others and ensure complete project modules are in working properly

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the implementation of Module 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA), creating a comprehensive autonomous humanoid system that integrates all previous modules. The implementation includes three detailed chapters covering VLA systems fundamentals, voice-to-action interfaces, and the capstone autonomous humanoid project. All content has been integrated into the Docusaurus documentation system with proper navigation and cross-references to previous modules.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Module 4 implementation with comprehensive content covering Vision-Language-Action systems, voice-to-action interfaces, and autonomous humanoid capstone project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created 3 chapter files, updated sidebar, completed all planning and implementation artifacts
- 🔁 Next prompts: Module 4 review, potential UI enhancements for all modules
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated all four Physical AI modules into a cohesive learning experience with proper technical depth and accessibility

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: No automated PHR creation script available, had to create manually
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement automated PHR creation functionality
